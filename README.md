# Persona 5 Beta Documentation
Documentation and translation efforts of the Persona 5 beta debug build dated **26/February/2016**

***UPDATE:*** With the recent release of the **December 2015**, **March 2016**, and **June 2016** builds, efforts to translate these builds will begin once this current build has its debug features translated to make porting over these translations to the other builds much quicker.

This patch.yml file includes various quality-of-life patches, such as mod.cpk support and patching assertion failures from crashing the game (Thanks to DeathChaos and SecreC. respectively!)

Translation efforts are on-going; many thanks to:
* Century_
* Lyn/CherryCreamSoda
* Scarltz

[Click here](https://github.com/KingJackSkellington/p5-beta-documentation/blob/main/patch.yml) to download the patch.yml file.
* NOTE 1: If you don't want to fully replace your patch.yml file, copy everything ***except*** the `Version 1.2` line, and paste it at the bottom of your patch.yml file.
* NOTE 2: If you ***don't*** have a mod.cpk file in the USRDIR directory, make sure to **disable** the `Mod Cpk Support` patch before booting the build; otherwise it _will_ crash.
